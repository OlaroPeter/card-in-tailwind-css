This project demonstrates a simple card layout styled with Tailwind CSS using its CDN. By including the Tailwind CSS CDN in the <head> of the HTML file, we avoid the need for local installations or complex build steps. Tailwindâ€™s utility-first approach allows us to quickly style the card with pre-defined classes for responsiveness, padding, borders, shadows, and typography, all without writing custom CSS. This makes it easy to create clean, modern designs with minimal effort, while maintaining a fast and responsive development process.
